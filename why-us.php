		Indians have a heritage that deeply links with the lifestyle of Zero Carbon Emission and organic-based agriculture practices in our ancient times. Therefore, we intend to cut the commercial vested interests to promote the sustainable process of creating farmlands with Emission Free Independent Energy and Organic Farming through the funding/subsidy allotted in bringing rooftop solar or windmill projects that are the schemes brought by World Bank Initiative for climate change action, Central Government of India for renewable energy and various State Governments for green energy initiative.

	<p class="text-justify" style="font-weight: 400;color: #555;line-height: 1.7em;font-size: 17px;">
		We will be your drivers for climate change action and in creating a sustainable life.
