  		We are a group of young Engineers, Agriculturists and Business entrepreneurs who have lived and travelled across the planet working in various fields with wide knowledge. In our due course of life, we realized the need for a life balanced with sustainability which starts from removing the commercial interests behind basic and essential commodities, and critical subjects. Therefore, we joined hands to combat climate change along with the high industrial chemical-based fertilizer food production.

  		We are based on a village in Warangal. We all come from the roots of farming families. Our mission is to help the farming community with basic free electricity with the funds that we receive in the subsidy provided from the Government for renewable energy and the profit we make through this venture. The Green Energy Power Organisation is a trade name that is administered and operated by Powerganic Foundation. (For more information about Powerganic Foundation click here)
